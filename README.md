A New Approach to Thermal Imaging Visualisation
===============================================

This repository contains an EngD group project completed by Jessica Wardlaw, Fabian Wanner and Maciej Gryka in 2010 at University College London.

The aim of the project was to create a method for merging multispectral building data into one, interactive 3D model.

This code has not been touched since 2010 and is presented mostly as a historical reference :)

Please get in touch if you like it and/or find it useful.
